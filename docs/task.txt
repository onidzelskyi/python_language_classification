1. The Language Classification Problem:

This outlines a machine learning problem in which you are required to create a model that can discriminate between English, Afrikaans, and Dutch phrases. A labelled dataset of phrases is provided/attached (lang_data.csv).

Requirements:

Implementation
You must implement your machine learning model in Python.
You are free to use external Python libraries, but pre-trained models may not be used.
You will have to submit your code, as well as a trained model.
Include instructions for executing your code with the provided (trained) model.

Report
In addition to the code and model, you must also submit a report. The report should contain at least the following:
a brief overview of the libraries used in your implementation,
a complete overview of any data analyses, preparation, and/or feature extraction that you performed,
a complete overview of your model’s architecture,
a complete overview of the training process, including detailed discussions of any specific techniques and/or algorithms used in your implementation,
an overview of the testing process,
an overview and discussion of the results, including your model’s performance on each language, and how it can potentially be improved..
Where applicable, justify any choices you make in your approach.
Also answer the bonus questions (see below) in your report.
Bonus Questions:
To improve your chances, answer the following questions in your report. You may include these answers as part of discussions throughout your report, or answer them directly in a separate section.

Discuss two machine learning approaches (other than the one you used in your language classification implementation) that would also be able to perform the task. Explain how these methods could be applied instead of your chosen method.
Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.
Explain the difference between classification and regression.
In supervised classification tasks, we are often faced with datasets in which one of the classes is much more prevalent than any of the other classes. This condition is called class imbalance. Explain the consequences of class imbalance in the context of machine learning.
Explain how any negative consequences of the class imbalance problem (explained in question 4) can be mitigated.
Provide a short overview of the key differences between deep learning and any non-deep learning method.
